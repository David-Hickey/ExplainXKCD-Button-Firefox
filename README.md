# ExplainXKCD-Button Firefox Addon
Firefox extension that changes one of the [XKCD](https://www.xkcd.com/) nav buttons to an 'Explain' button which links to the relevant [ExplainXKCD](https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) page. The button that is replaced can be configured from the extension settings menu.

## Installation

#### The Easy Way

Make sure you're using Firefox. Just go to the releases tab and click the `.xpi` file in the latest release. Firefox will ask if you want to allow the addon to be installed, so click "Allow". That's it! You're done.

#### The Hard Way

If Firefox tells you it prevented this site asking you to install software, either change your Firefox settings or download the `.xpi` file. Then, go to the addons menu, click the little cog near the top right, then click `Install Add-on From File`. Find the `.xpi` file you downloaded, double click, and you're done.
